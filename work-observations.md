Large Dataset processing - limitations of each architecture:
- R: no bigger files than 2 GB.
  - it loads everything into memory.
- SAS: huge files are relative.
  - dependent on your CPU and Disk Bandwidth
- Python: depends on your library usage and how you are storing data.
- SQL: huge files are relative.
  - dependent on your server utility and other operations
- AWK / SED / GREP: extremely agile, but very complicated.
