# on languages

## learned
* sas
* r
* python
* c# 
* c++ 
* java
* c
* sql

## of the ones learned, my favorites
* python
* c  
* ~~sas <- i didn't expect this, but sas is snappy and can take my sql queries.~~

## to learn
* julia (maybe... i need to focus on mastering python nuances)
* go (maybe... same story as above, just on c)

## worst
mostly i don't love the amount of typing to get anything done. they're not known for their brevity...  
* java
* c#

## mediocre
* r <- if you have a limited dataset, sure: r works great. but i wouldn't dare use r to parse raw census data or cdc mortality files.
* sql <- more of a medium of expression than a language, imo. it's almost like markup in a way (beefy, move whole mountains, markup). i also have this strange dichotomy where i use microsoft azure sql server at work and postgresql at home. i have to wade through propritary systems... when really i just want to use open source solutions. *sigh*   
* sas <- began to have issues with how it executes sql procs (different agg functions...), and it has curious differences from stata and sudaan when it comes to probablility outcomes. also... it's too pricey to develop a dependancy on. especially if i go elsewhere that doesn't invest in sas.
