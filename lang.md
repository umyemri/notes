## of the ones learned, my favorites
* python
* c
* sas <- i didn't expect this, but sas is snappy and can take my sql queries.

## to learn
* julia
* go

## worst
mostly i don't love the amount of typing to get anything done. they're not known for their brevity...  
* java
* c#

## mediocre
* r - if you have a limited dataset, sure: r works great. but i wouldn't dare use r to parse raw census data or cdc mortality files.
