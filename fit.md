# fitness stuff

## current program
* MWF@5:30AM: SL 5x5 - Barbell only motions
* TT@5:30AM: Cardio - 113 to 132 BPM
* S-F@7:00PM: OMAD (keto) - fish, nuts, asparagus, burssel sprouts, avocado, cheese, coffee  
  * no beer, wine is fine.
  * cheat when you feel like, but don't make a habit of it.

## str goals
* squat: 315lbs 5x5
* deads: 405lbs 1x5
* ohp  : 135lbs 5x5
* bench: 225lbs 5x5
* row  : 185lbs 5x5
* cardi: cycles or ellipticals 

progression assumes no stalling, but that's pretty unreasonable.  

omad IF will definitely make me reset a lot.
